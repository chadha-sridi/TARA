# TARA 
Threat Assessment and Remediation Analysis is a threat modeling methodology used to 
identify and assess cyber vulnerabilities and select the effective countermeasures in mitigating those 
vulnerabilities. TARA is part of a <b>MITRE</b> portfolio of systems security engineering.
<p>You can find more details about it at this link: https://www.mitre.org/news-insights/publication/threat-assessment-and-remediation-analysis-tara </p>
<h2>Threat modeling</h2>
Threat modeling is of capital importance in building secure systems and applications. It's a process that's continuously carried out throughout the different phases of the system's lifecycle. 
<p>In general, regardless of the used methodology, the following questions have to be tackled: </p>
<li>What are you building</li>
<li>What can go wrong ie threat enumeration: identify, categorize, analyze, and prioritize the risks to respond to</li>
<li>What should you do about it: Mitigation</li>
<li>Validation</li>
<p>

  In this repository, I provide a mindmap summary for the TARA framework.</p>
